        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h4>Just finished school. 4 years of taking up Mechanical Engineering skills and knowledge was enriching to say the least. 
            But I strongly feel an urge take up a new challenge. One that will grant me bountiful opportunities. 
            So I find myself learning an array of skills that relate to Financial Technology. 
            From learning the javascrpt language, to understanding useful tools such as git, it has thus far made me rediscover my interests, 
            and ultimately what I intend to pursue in the future.

            internship with Schlumberger in SWTC, short for Singapore Well Testing Centre (SWTC). The building is a hub of the development 
            and production of the multiphase flowmeter (MPFM), which is a vital equipment for oil extraction.

            My official title was Mechanical Engineer (Intern). I was attached to the Engineering department 
            in SWTC where the department's main goal is to develop a new version of the MPFM. My job scope includes creating 
            virtual 3D models for the parts that contribute to the end product using Creo, performing tolerance stack on parts that 
            go to the final assembly and help out with calculations for the electrical and electronics team.

            be possible at that point of time as humans finally cracked the code on quantum tunneling. But how about the grass you 
            might ask?  Is it going to still be trimmed using old-fashioned weed trimmers? Of course not! We'll probably have

            A project where I led a team of 6 to build an autonomous grass-cutting robot. The basic idea is that the system 
            allows us to input a route and when the cutting operation starts, the robot will follow the designated route through 
            the utilisation of a Real-Time Kinematics system that compliments and enhances the accuracy of the GPS module in the 
            circuit. An accuracy of 1-2cm to be exact.

            be the link between stakeholders, module coordinaters and the team members. In addition, I had the opportunity to use my 
            CAD and structural analysis skills to create 3D visualisations of the robot and carry out simulations to ensure the 
            dimensions are obtained before the team starts machining the chassis of the robot.

            <div class="col-md-8">
            <h4>Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is an integral part of a programmer's life. The tools that relate to CI/CD are used to ensure a synchronised flow between the development of codes and it's deployment. Here, I explored
                a few of those tools to get myself in tuned to the daily practices of a developer. I have played out the whole concept by using these tools alongside a small python app that I am working on.
                <br>
                Firstly, I utilised git, a version control system that allows for work on the same set of codes without causing conflicts between the the working code and the main code. Secondly, 
                github actions was used to ensure testing is done on the programme before being deployed. Notifications (telegram and email) were also set for every commit or deployment and it is configured through the yml file and read in github actions. 
                Notifications are essential as it alerts all members of the team who are working on the code of the latest changes.
                <br>
                Lastly, I have incorporated the use of docker with a dockerfile within the project file. This dockerfile, when run, will create a docker image. This means that the deployment process can be easily carried out in different machines despite not having 
                certain required modules (eg. libraries of python such as requests). 
                <br>

                    <br>
                    In this project, Flask was used with MongoDB as a database. A noSQL database was used because as of now, the web app does not require high volume of data and data can be easily read and written with this type of structure.
