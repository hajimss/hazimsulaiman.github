        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h4>Just finished school. 4 years of taking up Mechanical Engineering skills and knowledge was enriching to say the least. 
            But I strongly feel an urge take up a new challenge. One that will grant me bountiful opportunities. 
            So I find myself learning an array of skills that relate to Financial Technology. 
            From learning the javascrpt language, to understanding useful tools such as git, it has thus far made me rediscover my interests, 
            and ultimately what I intend to pursue in the future.

            a long list of oil and gas companies (eg. ExxonMobil, Shell). In the second half of 2018, I had the privilege of doing an 
            internship with Schlumberger in SWTC, short for Singapore Well Testing Centre (SWTC). The building is a hub of the development 
            and production of the multiphase flowmeter (MPFM), which is a vital equipment for oil extraction.

        <h4>
            My official title was Mechanical Engineer (Intern). I was attached to the Engineering department 
            in SWTC where the department's main goal is to develop a new version of the MPFM. My job scope includes creating 
            virtual 3D models for the parts that contribute to the end product using Creo, performing tolerance stack on parts that 
            go to the final assembly and help out with calculations for the electrical and electronics team.

            The year is 2520. We have flying cars taking up the lower section of the airspace. . Well teleportation might even 
            be possible at that point of time as humans finally cracked the code on quantum tunneling. But how about the grass you 
            might ask?  Is it going to still be trimmed using old-fashioned weed trimmers? Of course not! We'll probably have 
            fully autonomous bots that go around the neighbourhood making sure the highly robust plants do not grow out of the 
            space in which they are kept in(??).

            A project where I led a team of 6 to build an autonomous grass-cutting robot. The basic idea is that the system 
            allows us to input a route and when the cutting operation starts, the robot will follow the designated route through 
            the utilisation of a Real-Time Kinematics system that compliments and enhances the accuracy of the GPS module in the 
            circuit. An accuracy of 1-2cm to be exact.

            As the head of the team, I was in charge of coordinating ideas, developing a timeline to meet the assigned deadlines and 
            be the link between stakeholders, module coordinaters and the team members. In addition, I had the opportunity to use my 
            CAD and structural analysis skills to create 3D visualisations of the robot and carry out simulations to ensure the 
            dimensions are obtained before the team starts machining the chassis of the robot.
