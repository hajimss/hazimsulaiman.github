        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h4>Just finished school. 4 years of taking up Mechanical Engineering skills and knowledge was enriching to say the least. 
            But I strongly feel the need to take up a new challenge. One that will grant me buontiful opportunities. 
            So I find myself learning an array of skills that relate to Financial Technology. 
            From learning the javascrpt language, to understanding useful tools such as git, it has thus far made me rediscover my interests, 
            and ultimately what I intend to pursue in the future.

        <h3>What is it about?</h3>
        <h4>Schlumberger is an oil and gas services company. In short, it manufactures and provides sevices to 
            a long list of oil and gas companies (eg. ExxonMobil, Shell). In the second half of 2018, I had the privilege of doing an 
            internship with Schlumberger in SWTC, short for Singapore Well Testing Centre (SWTC). The building is a hub of the development 
            and production of the multiphase flowmeter (MPFM), which is a vital equipment for oil extraction.
        </h4>
        <h4>
            My official title was Mechanical Engineer (Intern). I was attached to the Engineering department 
            in SWTC where the department's main goal is to develop a new version of the MPFM. My job scope includes creating 
            virtual 3D models for the parts that contribute to the end product.
